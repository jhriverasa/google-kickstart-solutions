# Google Kickstart Solutions
This repo (will) cointain all solutions to Google Kickstart, I decided to put them here, in order to have a "log" and check my progress in competitive programming. I would like to have these solutions in different languages ( C++, Java, Python ..), maybe in the future, however, Im using Python for now.
